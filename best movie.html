 <h1>Why I like the movie</h1>
 <p> This is my favorite movie for a lot of reasons. First of all I like you there
 is a time machine and people can travel back in time. Also I like how the robot can
 pass as human.</p>
 
 <h1>Favorite Actor</h1>
 <p> My favorite actor in this is Arnold swarstzanneger. He is really good at making his voice
 sound like a robot which is cool. Also its cool that he was an actor then he became
 governor of California.</p>
