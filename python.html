		In unit 1 of Python we learned how to make a figure show up on the screen by
		creating a class then importing that class file into a runner. We had to draw the figure 
		after drawing the screen so the scrren wouldnt be over it. 
		</h3>
		<h3>
		Examples:
		</h3>
		<p> Lab Runner: </p>
		<img src="images/LabRunner.png" width="460" height="400"/>
		<h3>
		<h3>
		Description:
		<p>
		We drew the figure and had it move around with the arrow keys
		</p>
		</h3>
		In unit 2 of Python we learned how to use if statement to make our Hopper move. We
		also learned how to tell when an object collides with another object.
		</h3>
		<h3>
		Examples:
		</h3>
		<p>Hopper Runner: </p>
		<img src="images/hopperRunner.png" width="460" height="400"/>
		<h3>
		Description:
		<p>
		We drew the figure and the wall and had the guy move around with the arrow keys and have
		it collide with the wall so it couldn't go throught the wall.
		</p>
		</h3>
		<h3>
		In unit 3 of Python we learned how to use for in and while loops. These are super useful.
		We learned how to create a background using for in loops and how to create a random
		number.
		</h3>
		<h3>
		Examples:
		</h3>
		<p> Ground Runner: </p>
		<img src="images/groundRunner.png" width="460" height="400"/>
		<h3>
		Description:
		<p>
		We drew the guy and had it move around with the arrow keys and created a backround with rocks
		randomly places. When ever the guy touches the coin the coin moves to a random place and the score
		goes up but you you run out of time before you get 20 points you lose.
		</p>
		</h3>
		
		<h3>
		In unit 4 of Python we learned how to use lists to create multiple objects.
		</h3>
		<h3>
		Examples:
		</h3>
		<p> Dodge Runner: </p>
		<img src="images/dodgeRunner.png" width="460" height="400"/>
		<h3>
		Description:
		<p>
		In dodge runner you had to get across the dirt without any of the aliens hitting you to win.
		We used lists to draw and add aliens.
		</p>
		</h3>
		
		<h3>
		This is my own project
		In unit 4 of Python we learned how to use lists to create multiple objects.
		</h3>
		<h3>
		Examples:
		</h3>
		<p> Ball Tag: </p>
		<img src="images/ballTag.png" width="460" height="400"/>
		<h3>
		Description:
		<p>
		I created my own game where you controled a paddle that moved up and down with the arrow keys and '
		the player tried to hit the yellow balls that came out of the left edge before they hit the right edge.
		Each time you hit the yellow balls you get a point but if it hits the right edge you lose a life.
		</p>
