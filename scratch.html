		<h2> Description: </h2>
		<p>
		Use scratch to design and create a program that shows my name. 
		The requirements were to add a sprite for each letter in my name
		and give them 3 unique behaviors. The program needed to run when 
		the green flag was pressed and for extra credit I added a function
		to reset the scene to the beginning each time the green flag was clicked.

		</P>
		
		<h2> Concepts Learned: </h2>
	<h4>	
		<ul>
		   <li> Using event blocks - green flag pressed, when key pressed
                  </li>
            <li> Conditional statements - used if statements to say if this happens do this </li>
          <li> Used loops - I used a forever block to have it jump forever</li>
		  <li> Sprites - I created my sprites in the sprite editor</li>
          <li> Movement - I used the x and y values to make my sprites move to their original
		  location when the green flag was clicked,  I used a variable to make my sprites jump,
		  and I used the change size to have my sprites change size. </li>
		</ul>
		Computer buying project:
		</h4>
		<p>
		<img src="images/computerbuying.jpg" width="600" height="400"/>
		</p>
		<h2> Description: </h2>
		<p>
		 Interview someone about what they would want in a computer if they were to buy one.
		 Then pick four computers that fit their description and create a scratch presentation
		 explaining each computer and finally choosing which one would be best for the person
		 you interviewed.
		</P>
		<h2> Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<p>
		 learned how to create a page system using a variable called page#.
		 I set each slide to a certain page# and also some pictures.

		</p>
		<h5> Final Project </h5>
		<p>
		<img src="images/gameproject.jpg" width="600" height="400"/>
		</p>
		<h2> Description: </h2>
		<p>
		 The game had to have a timer, keep score, have a help screen with directions,
		 reset when the green flag is clicked, let the player know when they win,
		 and have the game get harder as it goes on.

		</p>
		<h2> Concepts Learned: </h2>
		<p>
		I learned how to make something pop up on a random timer using wait pick random.
		Also I learned how to have one sprite point in the direction of another one by using
		set in direction of sprite.
